# asynchronous_examples
asynchronous examples for Python3 (tested on Python v3.8.0)

use example **sockets_and_selectors.py**:
1.  in the first console execute `python3.8 sockets_and_selectors.py`
1.  in the second console execute `nc localhost 8777`
1.  in the third console execute `nc localhost 8777`
1.  on any input for the second and the third consoles you get message from server.
